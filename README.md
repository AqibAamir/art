This code uses the Turtle graphics library to create a variety of intricate geometric patterns and shapes, including spirals, stars, grids, waves, and more. It sets up a turtle artist on a black background, and allows for the drawing of random shapes with varying parameters like color, size, and number of repetitions. The user can interactively select shapes and colors to be drawn, and the program also includes pre-set patterns such as gradients, checkerboards, and radial designs. Finally, the main() function orchestrates the drawing process and prompts the user for input to generate multiple art pieces.
